◦ What does the character d represent in the output?
d is the character that identifies a directory.
◦ Why are the sizes given in human readable format?
Due the option -h.
◦ What would be the difference in the output if ls was used with no argument?
Directory and file names would be provided only.
2. Consider the command below:
$ cp /home/frank/emp_name /home/frank/backup
◦ What would happen to the file emp_name if this command is executed successfully?
emp_name would be copied into backup.
◦ If emp_name was a directory what option should be added to cp to execute the command?
-r
◦ If cp is now changed to mv what results do you expect?
emp_name would be moved into backup. It would no longer be present inside the home
directory of user frank.
3. Consider the listing :
$ ls
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt
Which wildcard would help to delete all the contents of this directory?
The asterisk *.
4. Based on the previous listing, what files would be displayed by the following command?
$ ls file*.txt
All of them, since the asterisk character represents any number of characters.
5. Complete the command by adding the appropriate digits and characters in the square brackets
that would list all the content above:
$ ls file[].txt
file[0-9].txt

1. In your home directory, create the files called dog and cat.
$ touch dog cat
2. Still in your home directory, create the directory called animal. Move dog and cat into
animal.
$ mkdir animal
$ mv dog cat -t animal/
3. Go to the Documents folder found in your home directory and inside, create the directory
backup.
$ cd ~/Documents
$ mkdir backup
4. Copy animal and its contents into backup.
$ cp -r animal ~/Documents/backup
5. Rename animal in backup to animal.bkup.
$ mv animal/ animal.bkup
6. The /home/lpi/databases directory contains many files which includes: db-1.tar.gz, db-
2.tar.gz and db-3.tar.gz. Which single command can you use to list only the files mention
above?
$ ls db-[1-3].tar.gz
7. Consider the listing:
$ ls
cne1222223.pdf cne12349.txt cne1234.pdf
With the use of a single globbing character, what command would remove only the pdf files?
$ rm *.pdf

1. Consider the following listing:
$ find /home/frank/Documents/ -type d
/home/frank/Documents/
/home/frank/Documents/animal
/home/frank/Documents/animal/domestic
/home/frank/Documents/animal/wild
◦ What kind of files would this command output?
Directories.
◦ In which directory does the search begins?
/home/frank/Documents
2. A user wishes to compress his backup folder. He uses the following command:
$ tar cvf /home/frank/backup.tar.gz /home/frank/dir1
Which option is lacking to compress the backup using the gzip algorithm?
Option -z.
1. As system administrator, it is required of you to perform regular checks in order to remove
voluminous files. These voluminous files are located in /var and end with a .backup
extension.
◦ Write down the command, using find, to locate these files:
$ find /var -name *.backup
◦ An analysis of the sizes of these files reveals that they range from 100M to 1000M. Complete
the previous command with this new information, so that you may locate those backup files
ranging from 100M to 1000M:
$ find /var -name *.backup -size +100M -size -1000M
◦ Finally, complete this command, with the delete action so that these files will be removed:
$ find /var -name *.backup -size +100M -size -1000M -delete
2. In the /var directory, there exist four backup files:
db-jan-2018.backup
db-feb-2018.backup
db-march-2018.backup
db-apr-2018.backup
◦ Using tar, specify the command that would create an archive file with the name db-firstquarter-
2018.backup.tar:
$ tar -cvf db-first-quarter-2018.backup.tar db-jan-2018.backup db-feb-2018.backup dbmarch-
2018.backup db-apr-2018.backup
◦ Using tar, specify the command that would create the archive and compress it using gzip.
Take note that the resulting file name should end with .gz:
$ tar -zcvf db-first-quarter-2018.backup.tar.gz db-jan-2018.backup db-feb-2018.backup
db-march-2018.backup db-apr-2018.backup
