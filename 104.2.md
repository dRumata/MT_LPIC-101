# 104.2 Maintain the integrity of filesystems

1. Using du, how can we check how much space is being used by just the files on the current
directory?
First, use the -S parameter to separate the output of the current directory from its
subdirectories. Then, use -d 0 to limit the output depth to zero, meaning “no subdirectories”.
Do not forget -h to get an output in an “human-readable” format:
$ du -S -h -d 0
or
$ du -Shd 0
2. Using df, list information for every ext4 filesystem, with the outputs including the following
fields, in order: device, mount point, total number of inodes, number of available inodes,
percentage of free space.
You can filter filesystems with the -t option followed by the filesystem name. To get the output
needed, use --output=source,target,itotal,iavail,pcent. So, the answer is:
$ df -t ext4 --output=source,target,itotal,iavail,pcent
3. What is the command to run e2fsck on /dev/sdc1 in non-interactive mode, while trying to
automatically fix most errors?
The parameter to automatically try to fix most errors is -p. So the answer is:
# e2fsck -p /dev/sdc1
4. Suppose /dev/sdb1 is an ext2 filesystem. How can you convert it to ext3 and at the same time
reset its mount count and change its label to UserData?
Remember that converting an ext2 filesystem to ext3 is just a matter of adding a journal, which
can be done with the -j parameter. To reset the mount count, use -C 0. To change the label
use -L UserData. The correct answer is:
# tune2fs -j -C 0 -L UserData /dev/sdb1
5. How can you check for errors on an XFS filesystem, without repairing any damage found?
Use the -n parameter, like in xfs -n, followed by the corresponding device.

1. Consider you have an ext4 filesystem on /dev/sda1 with the following parameters, obtained
with tune2fs:
Mount count: 8
Maximum mount count: -1
What will happen at the next boot if the command tune2fs -c 9 /dev/sda1 is issued?
The command will set the maximum mount count for the filesystem to 9. Since the mount
count is currently 8, the next system boot will cause a filesystem check.
2. Consider the following output of du -h:
$ du -h
216K ./somedir/anotherdir
224K ./somedir
232K .
How much space is occupied by just the files on the current directory? How could we rewrite
the command to show this information more clearly?
Of the total of 232 K used, 224 K are used by the subdirectory somedir and its subdirectories.
So, excluding those, we have 8K being occupied by the files on the current directory. This
information can be shown more clearly by using the -S parameter, which will separate the
directories in the count.
3. What would happen to the ext2 filesystem /dev/sdb1 if the command below is issued?
# tune2fs -j /dev/sdb1 -J device=/dev/sdc1 -i 30d
A journal will be added to /dev/sdb1, converting it to ext3. The journal will be stored on the
device /dev/sdc1 and the filesystem will be checked every 30 days.
4. How can we check for errors on a XFS filesystem on /dev/sda1 that has a log section on
/dev/sdc1, without actually making any repairs?
Use xfs_repair, followed by -l /dev/sdc1 to indicate the device containing the log section,
and -n to avoid making any changes.
# xfs_repair -l /dev/sdc1 -n
5. What is the difference between the -T and -t parameters for df?
The parameter -T will include the type of each filesystem in the output of df. -t is a filter, and
will show only filesystems of the given type on the output, excluding all others.
