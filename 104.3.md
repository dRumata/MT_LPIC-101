# 104.3 Control mounting and unmounting of filesystems

1. Using mount, how can you mount an ext4 filesystem on /dev/sdc1 to /mnt/external as
read-only, using the noatime and async options?
# mount -t ext4 -o noatime,async,ro /dev/sdc1 /mnt/external
2. When unmounting a filesystem at /dev/sdd2, you get the target is busy error message.
How can you find out which files on the filesystem are open, and what processes opened them?
Use lsof followed by the device name:
$ lsof /dev/sdd2
3. Consider the following entry in /etc/fstab: /dev/sdb1 /data ext4
noatime,noauto,async. Will this filesystem be mounted if the command mount -a is issued?
Why?
It will not be mounted. The key is the noauto parameter, which means this entry be ignored by
mount -a.
4. How can you find out the UUID of a filesystem under /dev/sdb1?
Use lsblk -f, followed by the filesystem name:
$ lsblk -f /dev/sdb1
5. How can you use mount to remount as read-only an exFAT filesystem with the UUID
6e2c12e3-472d-4bac-a257-c49ac07f3761, mounted at /mnt/data?
Since the filesystem is mounted, you do not need to worry about the filesystem type or the ID,
just use the remount option with the ro (read-only) parameter and the mount point:
# mount -o remount,ro /mnt/data
6. How can you get a list of all ext3 and ntfs filesystems currently mounted on a system?
Use mount -t, followed by a comma-separated list of filesystems:
# mount -t ext3,ntfs

1. Consider the following entry in /etc/fstab: /dev/sdc1 /backup ext4
noatime,nouser,async. Can a user mount this filesystem with the command mount
/backup? Why?
No, the parameter nouser will not allow ordinary users to mount this filesystem.
2. Consider a remote filesystem mounted at /mnt/server, which has become unreachable due to
a loss of network connectivity. How could you force it to be unmounted, or mounted as readonly
if this is not possible?
Pass the -f and -r parameters to unmount. The command would be umount -f -r
/mnt/server. Remember that you can group parameters, so umount -fr /mnt/server
would also work.
3. Write an /etc/fstab entry that would mount an btrfs volume with the label Backup on
/mnt/backup, with default options and without allowing the execution of binaries from it.
The line should be LABEL=Backup /mnt/backup btrfs defaults,noexec
4. Consider the following systemd mount unit:
[Unit]
Description=External data disk
[Mount]
What=/dev/disk/by-uuid/56C11DCC5D2E1334
Where=/mnt/external
Type=ntfs
Options=defaults
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
â—¦ What would be an equivalent /etc/fstab entry for this filesystem?
The entry would be: UUID=56C11DCC5D2E1334 /mnt/external ntfs defaults
5. What should be the file name for the unit above, so it can be used by systemd? Where should it
be placed?
The filename must be the same as the mount point, so mnt-external.mount, placed in
/etc/systemd/system.
