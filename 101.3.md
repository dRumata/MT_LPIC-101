# 101.3 Change runlevels / boot targets and shutdown or reboot system

1. The bootloader will present a list of operating systems to choose from when more than one
operating system is installed on the machine. However, a newly installed operating system can
overwrite the MBR of the hard disk, erasing the first stage of the bootloader and making the
other operating system inaccessible. Why would this not happen on a machine equipped with a
UEFI firmware?
UEFI machines do not use the hard disk’s MBR to store the first stage of the bootloader.
2. What is a common consequence of installing a custom kernel without providing an appropriate
initramfs image?
The root filesystem may be inaccessible if its type was compiled as an external kernel module.
3. The initialization log is hundreds of lines long, so the output of dmesg command is often piped
to a pager command — like command less — to facilitate the reading. What dmesg option will
automatically paginate its output, eliminating the need to use a pager command explicitly?
Commands dmesg -H or dmesg --human will enable the pager by default.
4. A hard drive containing the entire filesystem of an offline machine was removed and attached
to a working machine as a secondary drive. Assuming its mount point is /mnt/hd, how would
journalctl be used to inspect the contents of the journal files located at
/mnt/hd/var/log/journal/?
With commands journalctl -D /mnt/hd/var/log/journal or journalctl
--directory=/mnt/hd/var/log/journal
1. In a SysV based system, suppose the default runlevel defined in /etc/inittab is 3, but the
system always starts in runlevel 1. What is the probable cause for that?
The parameters 1 or S may be present in the kernel’s parameter list.
2. Although file /sbin/init can be found in systemd based systems, it is only a symbolic link to
another executable file. In such systems, what is the file pointed by /sbin/init?
The main systemd binary: /lib/systemd/systemd.
3. How can the default system target be verified in a systemd based system?
The symbolic link /etc/systemd/system/default.target will point to the unit file defined
as the default target. Command systemctl get-default can also be used.
4. How can a system reboot scheduled with the shutdown command be canceled?
The command shutdown -c should be used.
