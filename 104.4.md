# 104.5 Manage file permissions and ownership

1. Create a directory named emptydir using the command mkdir emptydir. Now, using ls, list
the permissions for the directory emptydir.
Add the -d parameter to ls to see the file attributes of a directory, instead of listing its
contents. So, the answer is:
ls -l -d emptydir
Bonus points if you merged the two parameters in one, as in ls -ld emptydir.
2. Create an empty file named emptyfile with the command touch emptyfile. Now, using
chmod on symbolic mode, add execute permissions for the owner of the file emptyfile, and
remove write and execute permissions for everyone else. Do this using only one chmod
command.
Think about it this way:
◦ “For the user who owns the file (u) add (+) execute (x) permissions”, so u+x.
◦ “For the group (g) and other users (o), remove (-) write (w) and execute (x) permissions”, so
go-wx.
To combine these two sets of permissions, we add a comma between them. So the final
result is:
chmod u+x,go-wx emptyfile
3. What would the default permissions be for a file if the umask value is set to 027?
The permissions would be rw-r-----
4. Let us assume a file named test.sh is a shell script with the following permissions and
ownership:
-rwxr-sr-x 1 carol root 33 Dec 11 10:36 test.sh
◦ What are the permissions for the owner of the file?
The permissions for the owner (2nd to 4th characters in the output of ls -l) are rwx, so the answer is: “to read, to write to and to execute the file”.
◦ Using the octal notation, which should be the syntax of chmod to “unset” the special
permission granted to this file?
We can “unset” the special permissions by passing a 4th digit, 0, to chmod. The current
permissions are 755, so the command should be chmod 0755.
5. Consider this file:
$ ls -l /dev/sdb1
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 17 Dec 21 18:51 /dev/sdb1
Which type of file is sdb1? Who can write to it?
The first character on the output of ls -l shows the type of file. b is a block device, usually a
disk (internal or external), connected to the machine. The owner (root) and any users of the
group disk can write to it.
6. Consider the following 4 files:
drwxr-xr-t 2 carol carol 4,0K Dec 20 18:46 Another_Directory
----r--r-- 1 carol carol 0 Dec 11 10:55 foo.bar
-rw-rw-r-- 1 carol carol 1,2G Dec 20 18:22 HugeFile.zip
drwxr-sr-x 2 carol users 4,0K Jan 18 17:26 Sample_Directory
Write down the corresponding permissions for each file and directory using octal mode using
the 4-digit notation.
The corresponding permissions, in octal mode, are as follows:
Another_Directory 1755. 1 for the sticky bit, 755 for the regular
permissions (rwx for the user, r-x for group
and others).
foo.bar 0044. No special permissions (so the first digit
is 0), no permissions for the user (---) and
just read (r—r--) for group and others.
HugeFile.zip 0664. No special permissions, so the first digit
is 0. 6 (rw-) for the user and group, 4 (r--) for
the others.
Sample_Directory 2755. 2 for the SGID bit, 7 (rwx) for the user, 5
(r-x) for the group and others.

1. Try this on a terminal: create an empty file called emptyfile with the command touch
emptyfile. Now “zero out” the permissions for the file with chmod 000 emptyfile. What will
happen if you change the permissions for emptyfile by passing only one value for chmod in
octal mode, like chmod 4 emptyfile? And if you use two, as in chmod 44 emptyfile? What
can we learn about the way chmod reads the numerical value?
Remember that we “zeroed out” the permissions for emptyfile. So, its initial state would be:
---------- 1 carol carol 0 Dec 11 10:55 emptyfile
Now, let us try the first command, chmod 4 emptyfile:
$ chmod 4 emptyfile
$ ls -l emptyfile
-------r-- 1 carol carol 0 Dec 11 10:55 emptyfile
See? The permissions for others were changed. And what if we try two digits, like in chmod 44
emptyfile?
$ chmod 44 emptyfile
$ ls -l emptyfile
----r--r-- 1 carol carol 0 Dec 11 10:55 emptyfile
Now, the permissions for group and others were affected. From this, we can conclude that in
octal mode chmod reads the value “backwards”, from the least significant digit (others) to the
most significant one (user). If you pass one digit, you modify the permissions for others. With
two digits you modify group and others, and with three you modify user, group and others and
with four digits you modify user, group, others and the special permissions.
2. Consider the permissions for the temporary directory on a Linux system, /tmp:
$ ls -l /tmp
drwxrwxrwt 19 root root 16K Dec 21 18:58 tmp
User, group and others have full permissions. But can a regular user delete any files inside this
directory? Why is this the case?
/tmp is what we call a world writeable directory, meaning that any user can write to it. But we
don’t want one user messing with files created by others, so the sticky bit is set (as indicated by
the t on the permissions for others). This means that a user can delete files on /tmp, but only
those created by himself.
3. A file called test.sh has the following permissions: -rwsr-xr-x, meaning the SUID bit is set.
Now, run the following commands:
$ chmod u-x test.sh
$ ls -l test.sh
-rwSr-xr-x 1 carol carol 33 Dec 11 10:36 test.sh
What did we do? What does the uppercase S mean?
We removed execute permissions for the user who owns the file. The s (or t) takes the place of
the x on the output of ls -l, so the system needs a way to show if the user has execute
permissions or not. It does this by changing the case of the special character.
A lowercase s on the first group of permissions means that the user who owns the file has
execute permissions and that the SUID bit is set. An uppercase S means that the user who owns
the file lacks (-) execute permissions and that the SUID bit is set.
The same can be said for SGID, a lowercase s on the second group of permissions means that
the group who owns the file has execute permissions and that the SGID bit is set. An uppercase
S means that the group who owns the file lacks (-) execute permissions and that the SGID bit is
set.
This is also true for the sticky bit, represented by the t on the third group of permissions.
Lowercase t means sticky bit set and that others have execute permissions. Uppercase T means
sticky bit set and that others do not have execute permissions.
4. How would you create a directory named Box where all the files are automatically owned by
the group users, and can only be deleted by the user who created them?
This is a multi-step process. The first step is to create the directory:
$ mkdir Box
We want every file created inside this directory to be automatically assigned to the group
users. We can do this by setting this group as the owner of the directory, and then by setting
the SGID bit on it. We also need to make sure that any member of the group can write to that directory.
Since we do not care about what the other permissions are, and want to “flip” only the special
bits, it makes sense to use the symbolic mode:
$ chown :users Box/
$ chmod g+wxs Box/
Note that if your current user does not belong to the group users, you will have to use the
command sudo before the commands above to do the change as root.
Now for the last part, making sure that only the user who created a file is allowed to delete it.
This is done by setting the sticky bit (represented by a t) on the directory. Remember that it is
set on the permissions for others (o).
$ chmod o+t Box/
The permissions on the directory Box should be as follows:
drwxrwsr-t 2 carol users 4,0K Jan 18 19:09 Box
Of course, you can specify SGID and the sticky bit using only one chmod command:
$ chmod g+wxs,o+t Box/
Bonus points if you thought of that.
