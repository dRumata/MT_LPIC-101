# 102.4 Use Debian package management.

1. What is the command to install a package named package.deb using dpkg?
Pass the -i parameter to dpkg:
# dpkg -i package.deb
2. Using dpkg-query, find which package contains a file named 7zr.1.gz.
Add the -S parameter to dpkg-query:
# dpkg-query -S 7zr.1.gz
3. Can you remove a package called unzip from the system using dpkg -r unzip if the package
file-roller depends on it? If not, what would be the correct way to do it?
No. dpkg will not resolve dependencies, and will not let you remove a package if another
installed package depends on it. In this example, you could first remove file-roller
(assuming nothing depends on it) and then remove unzip, or remove both at the same time
with:
# dpkg -r unzip file-roller
4. How can you find out which package contains the file /usr/bin/unrar using the apt-file
utility?
Use the search parameter followed by the path (or filename):
# apt-file search /usr/bin/unrar
5. Using apt-cache, what is the command to show information for the package gimp?
Use the show parameter followed by the package name:
# apt-cache show gimp
1. Consider a repository with Debian source packages for the xenial distribution, hosted at
http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ and with packages for the universe component.
What would be the corresponding line to be added to /etc/apt/sources.list?
Source packages are of the deb-src type, so the line should be:
deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial universe
This line could also be added inside a .list file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. The name is
up to you but should be descriptive, something like xenial_sources.list.
2. While compiling a program, you come across an error message complaining that the header
file zzip-io.h is not present on your system. How can you find out which package provides
that file?
Use apt-file search to find which package contains a file not present in the system:
# apt-file search zzip-io.h
3. How can you ignore a dependency warning and remove a package using dpkg, even if there
are packages that depend on it in the system?
The parameter --force can be used, but this should never be done unless you know exactly
what you are doing, since there is a great risk that your system will be left in an inconsistent or
“broken” state.
4. How can you get more information about a package called midori using apt-cache?
Use apt-cache show followed by the package name:
# apt-cache show midori
5. Before installing or updating packages with apt-get, which command should be used to
ensure that the package index is up-to-date?
apt-get update should be used. This will download the latest package indexes from the
repositories described in the /etc/apt/sources.list file or in the
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory.
