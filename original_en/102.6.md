# 102.6 Linux as a virtualization guest

1. What CPU extensions are necessary on an x86 based hardware platform that will run fully
virtualized guests?
VT-x for Intel CPUs or AMD-V for AMD CPUs
2. A mission-critical server installation that will require the fastest performance will likely use
what type of virtualization?
An operating system that makes use of paravirtualization, such as Xen, as the guest operating
system can make better use of hardware resources available to it through the use of software
drivers designed to work with the hypervisor.
3. Two virtual machines that have been cloned from the same template and that utilize D-Bus are
performing erratically. They both have separate hostnames and network configuration
settings. What command would be used to determine if each of the virtual machines have
different D-Bus Machine IDs?
dbus-uuidgen --get
1. Run the following command to see if your system already has CPU extensions enabled to run a
virtual machine (your results may vary depending on your CPU): grep --color -E
"vmx|svm" /proc/cpuinfo. Depending on the output, you may have "vmx" highlighted (for
Intel VT-x enabled CPU’s) or "svm" highlighted (for AMD SVM enabled CPU’s). Should you get no
results, consult your BIOS or UEFI firmware instructions on how to enable virtualization for
your processor.
The results will vary depending on your CPU that you have. Here is example output from a
computer with an Intel CPU with virtualization extensions enabled in the UEFI firmware:
$ grep --color -E "vmx|svm" /proc/cpuinfo

2. If your processor supports virtualizations, seek out your distribution’s documentation for
running a KVM hypervisor.
◦ Install the necessary packages to run a KVM hypervisor.
This will vary depending on your distribution, but here are some starting points:
Ubuntu — https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/libvirt.html
Fedora — https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/getting-started-with-virtualization/
Arch Linux — https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KVM
◦ If you are using a graphical desktop environment, it is recommended to also install the
virt-manager application which is a graphical front-end that can be used on a KVM
installation. This will aid in virtual machine installations and management.
Again, this will vary by distribution. An example using Ubuntu looks like this:
$ sudo apt install virt-manager
◦ Download a Linux distribution ISO image of your choice, and following your distribution’s
documentation create a new virtual machine using this ISO.
This task is easily handled by the virt-manager package. However a virtual machine can
be created from the command-line using the virt-install command. Try both methods to
get an understanding of how virtual machines are deployed.
