# 103.4 Use streams, pipes and redirects

1. In addition to text files, the command cat can also work with binary data, like sending the
contents of a block device to a file. Using redirection, how can cat send the contents of device
/dev/sdc to the file sdc.img in the current directory?
$ cat /dev/sdc > sdc.img
2. What’s the name of the standard channel redirected by the command date 1> now.txt?
Standard output or stdout
3. After trying to overwrite a file using redirection, a user gets an error informing that the option
noclobber is enabled. How can the option noclobber be deactivated for the current session?
set +C or set +o noclobber
4. What will be the result of command cat <<.>/dev/stdout?
Bash will enter Heredoc input mode, then exit when a period appears in a line by itself. The
typed text will be redirected to stdout (printed on screen).

1. The command cat /proc/cpu_info displays an error message because /proc/cpu_info is
nonexistent. The command cat /proc/cpu_info 2>1 redirects the error message to where?
To a file named 1 in the current directory.
2. Will it still be possible to discard content sent to /dev/null if the noclobber option is enabled
for the current shell session?
Yes. /dev/null is a special file not affected by noclobber.
3. Without using echo, how can the contents of the variable $USER be redirected to the stdin of
command sha1sum?
$ sha1sum <<<$USER
4. The Linux kernel keeps symbolic links in /proc/PID/fd/ to every file opened by a process,
where PID is the identification number of the corresponding process. How could the system
administrator use that directory to verify the location of log files opened by nginx, supposing
its PID is 1234?
By issuing the command ls -l /proc/1234/fd, which will display the targets of every
symbolic link in the directory.
5. It’s possible to do arithmetic calculations using only shell builtin commands, but floating point
calculations require specific programs, like bc (basic calculator). With bc it’s even possible to
specify the number of decimal places, with parameter scale. However, bc accepts operations
only through its standard input, usually entered in interactive mode. Using a Here string, how
could the floating point operation scale=6; 1/3 be sent to the standard input of bc?
$ bc <<<"scale=6; 1/3"

1. It’s convenient to save the execution date of actions performed by automated scripts. Command
date +%Y-%m-%d shows the current date in year-month-day format. How can the output of
such a command can be stored in a shell variable called TODAY using command substitution?
$ TODAY=`date +%Y-%m-%d`
or
$ TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
2. Using command echo, how can the contents of variable TODAY be sent to the standard input of
command sed s/-/./g?
$ echo $TODAY | sed s/-/./g
3. How could the output of command date +%Y-%m-%d be used as a Here string to command sed
s/-/./g?
$ sed s/-/./g <<< `date +%Y-%m-%d`
or
$ sed s/-/./g <<< $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
4. Command convert image.jpeg -resize 25% small/image.jpeg creates a smaller
version of image.jpeg and places the resulting image in a likewise named file inside
subdirectory small. Using xargs, how is it possible to perform the same command for every
image listed in file filelist.txt?
$ xargs -I IMG convert IMG -resize 25% small/IMG < filelist.txt
or
$ cat filelist.txt | xargs -I IMG convert IMG -resize 25% small/IMG

1. A simple backup routine periodically creates an image of partition /dev/sda1 with dd <
/dev/sda1 > sda1.img. To perform future data integrity checks, the routine also generates a
SHA1 hash of the file with sha1sum < sda1.img > sda1.sha1. By adding pipes and
command tee, how would these two commands be combined into one?
# dd < /dev/sda1 | tee sda1.img | sha1sum > sda1.sha1
2. Command tar is used to archive many files into a single file, preserving directory structure.
Option -T allows to specify a file containing the paths to be archived. For example, find /etc
-type f | tar -cJ -f /srv/backup/etc.tar.xz -T - creates a compressed tar file
etc.tar.xz from the list provided by command find (option -T - indicates the standard
input as the path list). In order to avoid possible parsing errors due to paths containing spaces,
what command options should be present for find and tar?
Options -print0 and --null:
$ find /etc -type f -print0 | tar -cJ -f /srv/backup/etc.tar.xz --null -T -
3. Instead of opening a new remote shell session, command ssh can just execute a command
indicated as its argument: ssh user@storage "remote command". Given that ssh also allows
to redirect the standard output of a local program to the standard input of the remote program,
how would the cat pipe a local file named etc.tar.gz to /srv/backup/etc.tar.gz at
user@storage through ssh?
$ cat etc.tar.gz | ssh user@storage "cat > /srv/backup/etc.tar.gz"
or
$ ssh user@storage "cat > /srv/backup/etc.tar.gz" < etc.tar.gz
