# 101.3 Change runlevels / boot targets and shutdown or reboot system

1. How could the telinit command be used to reboot the system?
The command telinit 6 will alternate to runlevel 6, that is, reboot the system.
2. What will happen to the services related to the file /etc/rc1.d/K90network when the system
enters runlevel 1?
Due to the letter K in the beginning of the file name, the related services will be stopped.
3. Using command systemctl, how could a user verify if the unit sshd.service is running?
With the command systemctl status sshd.service or systemctl is-active
sshd.service.
4. In a systemd based system, what command must be executed to enable activation of the unit
sshd.service during system initialization?
Command systemctl enable sshd.service, executed by root.

1. In a SysV based system, suppose the default runlevel defined in /etc/inittab is 3, but the
system always starts in runlevel 1. What is the probable cause for that?
The parameters 1 or S may be present in the kernelâ€™s parameter list.
2. Although file /sbin/init can be found in systemd based systems, it is only a symbolic link to
another executable file. In such systems, what is the file pointed by /sbin/init?
The main systemd binary: /lib/systemd/systemd.
3. How can the default system target be verified in a systemd based system?
The symbolic link /etc/systemd/system/default.target will point to the unit file defined
as the default target. Command systemctl get-default can also be used.
4. How can a system reboot scheduled with the shutdown command be canceled?
The command shutdown -c should be used.
