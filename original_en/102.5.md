# 102.5 Use RPM and YUM package management

1. Using rpm on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system, how would you install the package fileroller-3.28.1-2.el7.x86_64.rpm showing a progress bar during the installation?
Use the -i parameter to install a package, and the -h option to enable “hash marks” showing
installation progress. So, the answer is: rpm -ih file-roller-3.28.1-2.el7.x86_64.rpm.
2. Using rpm, find out which package contains the file /etc/redhat-release.
You are querying information about a file, so use the -qf parameter: rpm -qf /etc/redhatrelease.
3. How would you use yum to check for updates for all packages in the system?
Use the check-update operation without a package name: yum check-update.
4. Using zypper, how would you disable a repository called repo-extras?
Use the modifyrepo operation to change the parameters of a repo, and the -d parameter to
disable it: zypper modifyrepo -d repo-extras.
5. If you have a .repo file describing a new repository, where this file should be put so that it is
recognized by DNF?
.repo files for DNF should be put on the same place used by YUM, inside /etc/yum.repos.d/.
1. How would you use zypper to find out which package owns the file /usr/sbin/swapon?
Use the se (search) operator and the --provides parameter: zypper se --provides
/usr/sbin/swapon.
2. How can you get a list of all installed packages in the system using dnf?
Use the list operator, followed by the --installed parameter: dnf list --installed.
3. Using dnf, what is the command to add a repository located at
https://www.example.url/home:reponame.repo to the system?
Working with repositories is a “configuration change”, so use the config-manager and the
--add_repo parameter: dnf config-manager --add_repo
https://www.example.url/home:reponame.repo.
4. How can you use zypper to check if the package unzip is installed?
You need to do a search (se) on the installed (-i) packages: zypper se -i unzip.
5. Using yum, find out which package provides the file /bin/wget.
To find out what provides a file, use whatprovides and the filename: yum whatprovides
/bin/wget.
