# 104.7 Find system files and place files in the correct location

1. Imagine a program needs to create a single-use temporary file that will never be needed again
after the program is closed. What would be the correct directory to create this file in?
Since we don’t care about the file after the program finishes running, the correct directory is
/tmp.
2. Which is the temporary directory that must be cleared during the boot process?
The directory is /run or, on some systems, /var/run.
3. Using find, search only the current directory for files that are writable by the user, have been
modified in the last 10 days and are bigger than 4 GiB.
For this you will need the -writable, -mtime and -size parameters:
find . -writable -mtime -10 -size +4G
4. Using locate, find any files containing both the patterns report and either updated, update
or updating on their names.
Since locate needs to match all patterns, use the -A option:
locate -A "report" "updat"
5. How can you find where the manpage for ifconfig is stored?
Use the -m parameter for whereis:
whereis -m ifconfig
6. What variable needs to be added to /etc/updatedb.conf to make updatedb ignore ntfs
filesystems?
The variable is PRUNEFS= followed by the filesystem type: PRUNEFS=ntfs
7. A system administrator wishes to mount an internal disk (/dev/sdc1). According to the FHS,
under which directory should this disk be mounted?
In practice, the disk can be mounted anywhere. However, the FHS recommends that temporary mounts be done under /mnt
1. When locate is used, the results are pulled from a database generated by updatedb. However,
this database can be outdated, causing locate to show files that no longer exist. How can you
make locate show only existing files on its output?
Add the -e parameter to locate, as in locate -e PATTERN.
2. Find any file on the current directory or subdirectories up to 2 levels down, excluding mounted
filesystems, that contain the pattern Status or statute on their names.
Remember that for -maxdepth you have to also consider the current directory, so we want
three levels (the current plus 2 levels down):
find . -maxdepth 3 -mount -iname "*statu*"
3. Limiting the search to ext4 filesystems, find any files under /mnt that have at least execute
permissions for the group, are readable for the current user and had any attribute changed in
the last 2 hours.
Use the -fstype parameter of mount to limit the search to specific filesystem types. A file
readable by the current user would have at least 4 in the first digit of the permissions, and one
executable by the group would have at least 1 on the second digit. Since we don’t care about the
permissions for others, we can use 0 for the third digit. Use -cmin N to filter recent attribute
changes, remembering that N is specified in minutes. So:
find /mnt -fstype ext4 -perm -410 -cmin -120
4. Find empty files which were modified more than 30 days ago and are at least two levels down
from the current directory
The parameter -mindepth N can be used to limit the search to at least N levels down, but
remember that you have to include the current directory in the count. Use -empty to check for
empty files, and -mtime N to check for modification time. So:
find . -empty -mtime +30 -mindepth 3
5. Consider that the users carol and john are part of the group mkt. Find on john's home
directory any files that are also readable by carol.
Considering they are members of the same group, we need at least an r (4) on the group
permissions, and we do not care about the others. So:
find /home/john -perm -040
